VGG16 with SENet Blocks for Face Recognition

This project implements a VGG16 architecture enhanced with SENet blocks for face recognition using the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset. The model leverages the power of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and attention mechanisms through the SENet block to improve feature extraction and recognition accuracy. The code is implemented in PyTorch and includes model training, evaluation, and performance metrics. It demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to facial recognition tasks
